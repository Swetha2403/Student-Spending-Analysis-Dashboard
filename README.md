 # Project Objective
The objective of the project is to understand student spending behavior across various product categories and analyze how different store settings influence their purchasing decisions. This helps in identifying trends that can guide retailers in optimizing inventory and marketing strategies.

# Dataset
-<a href="https://github.com/Swetha2403/Student-Spending-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Student%20Survey.xls">Student Survey data</a>

# Question
1. Tabular Visualization: Format the total amount of purchase (TAP) based on ‘Store location’ and ‘Store setting’:
    • If 0<TAP<35000, then records should be in red color
    • If 35000<=TAP<60000, then records should be in yellow color 
    • If 0=60000, then records should be in Blue color 
2. Matrix Visualization: Create Matrix Visualization to show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and ‘Store setting’. Do the color formatting for the amount spent in total outdoor sports.
3. Funnel Chart: Create a Funnel chart to show Total amount of purchase by ‘Store setting’. Show the data labels as Percentage of First.
4. Pie Chart: Show the total amount of purchase by different ‘Store location’ for Suburban ‘Store setting’ only.
   Hint: Use Filter context
5. a) Scatter plot - Video games purchase and Outdoor sports spent across the different ages.
   b) Sand dance plot - Indoor sports and Video games spent across the different age groups. 
6. Restrict data access for the given users in the User mapping table. For example, Mani deals with Rural areas only so she should be able to view the data which belongs to Rural only, not urban and suburban         data. 
7. Publish the report on Power BI cloud service and Design the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel chart and scatter plots. Then create a schedule refresh for six times in every 4 hours for the Dashboard in a      day.
8. Use Q&A feature of Power BI,
   a) To show average age of students 
   b) Donut chart for total amount of purchases by ‘Store location’
